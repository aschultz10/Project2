**None of us can take human rights for granted**, not even here in the United States.
For our project, we created visualizations that show how well countries are perfoming based on human rights indicators, including an overall Quality of Life score.
Using information and data from [Human Rights Measurement Initiative] (https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/), we focused on five economic and social rights:

* right to education
* right to food
* right to health
* right to housing
* right to work

The average of the scores for those five rights are used to create the overall Quality of Life Score.

Humanrightsmeasurement.org is a project of **The Human Rights Measurement Initiative** which uses a unique
methodology to "show how well the state is using its available resources to ensure all people enjoy these rights. [They] do
this because under international law, a higher level of performance is expected from richer countries."

This analysis project can be used as a template for advocacy purposes and for shining a light on countries that 
are not doing as well as they should be.

The data from the website, constructed from publicly available data, includes 197 countries and is based on 10 years of tracking (2007-2017).
Not all rights data are available for every country.

## Conclusion

ADD  CONCLUSIONS BASED ON VISUALIZATIONS

For future projects, we would like to measure these rights against other indicators such as a country's military spending or its migration statistics (data is available at hungerreport.org).




## Proposal
  Objective & Strategy:
  - Use human rights parameters to understand country performance
  - Compare Country(s) to Global Standards
  - Using Three Measurements of Human Rights
 
     - Right to Health  
          - Children Surviving to Age 5
          - All Adults Age 15 Surviving to Age 60
          - Modern Contraceptive Use Rate
     - Right to Housing
          - People With at Least Basic Sanitation
          - People With Water on Premises
          - People in Bottom Quintile With Affordable Housing
     - Right to Work
          - People not absolutely poor (>3.20 2011 PPP$ per day)
          - People not relatively poor (>50% median income)
          - Unemployed not long-term (>12 months) unemployed
